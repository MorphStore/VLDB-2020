Please note: Inadvertently, we recorded only one repetition of the simple-query experiment, instead of ten repetitions as stated in the paper.
Consequently, the diagram in the paper (Figure 6) is based on only that one repetition.
We decided to include the original diagram from the paper here.
To make our diagram generation scripts work smoothly, we copied that one measurements file we have ten times.
That is, all ten files "simplequery_*.csv" have the same contents.
Nevertheless, we verified that the results shown in the paper are reproducible with 10 repetitions, and you can easily check that by re-running the experiments yourself.
